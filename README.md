## Description
Mooney's Bookstore is a project as a part of CS 5244 (Web Development) class where I independently led the full-cycle development of a bookstore website. I started from the UI/UX design phase in Figma and ended with deployment on a Tomcat Server. The frontend was built using ReactJS and TypeScript, while the backend was developed using Java and MySQL. This project showcases my full-stack development capabilities. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform that enhances the reading and shopping experience through innovative web functionalities.
